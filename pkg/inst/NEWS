2011-06-17:
  - Removed mkHelpDir() that has not worked for a while because of architectural
    changes in R.
  - Removed some unused variables from the C-code that caused warnings.
  - Corrected a bug in format.mtable() misusing the function character()
    and some other buglets reported by NOTE's in automatic runs by CRAN.

2011-05-29:
  - Applied patch sent by Christopher N. Lawrence, Ph.D. <c.n.lawrence@gmail.com>:
    Added support to mtable() for clm and clmm ordinal models in the ordinal package.
    Updates getSummary to support mer objects as generated by recent versions of the lme4 package.
    Adds the Aldrich & Nelson pseudo-R2 (Aldrich and Nelson 1984)
    to mtable output for various categorical models.

2011-05-14:

  - Fixed problems with SPSS system files that do not contain an 'info_flt64' record. This problem led to zeroes in the data section of the file being erroneously interpreted as *sysmis*.
  - Fixed 'show' and 'print' methods for 'data.set' objects - they no do fit the width set by options(width=...), without ugly line breaks.
  - Changed the default value of the 'compress.storage.modes' option for the
    subset and bracket methods o 'importer' objects to FALSE, which is much
    more safer.

2010-07-16:
  - fixed a bug in 'Simulate' that caused it to fail in certain situations
    in R version >= 2.11.

2010-04-12:
  - 'toLatex(mtable(<something>),useDcolumn=FALSE)' should now produce useable
    LaTeX output ($'s are added to the table entries).

2010-04-09:
  - 'By' works now with 'genTable' and 'aggregate.formula'. It gains a 'data.frame'
    method, which better cooperates with calls to 'lm'-like functions. Their results
    get a 'data' component containing the subset of the data frame that was given
    as 'data' argument to the call of 'By'.

2010-04-08:
  - fixed bug in 'cases'. It works now with target expressions even with 'within'.
  - 'write.mtable' now handles a 'forLaTeX=TRUE' option in a more convenient way.
  - 'mtable' now handles objects of classes "polr" and "simex", thanks to a contribution
    from Christopher N. Lawrence (Texas A&M International University)
  - support for 'mtable' output for "glm" objects with exponentiated coefficients
    and prelininary support for "lmer" object added, thanks to a contribution from
    Dave Atkins (Unversity of Washington). Also the coef.styles are changed to be
    more convenient.

2010-04-07:
  - fixed bug in C-level function 'read_sysfile_subset' that caused spurious errors
    while importing SPSS 'system' files with long strings.

2010-03-18:
  - patch to trimws to make it locale-neutral

2010-03-11:
  - fixed bugs in mtable and format.mtable. Short 'summary.stats'
    arguments or 'summary.stats=FALSE' should work now.

2010-03-06:
  - fixed bug in genTable/percentage: total counts disappeared if
    a factor level had the same name as the name given to the total count
  - changed the default value of the 'digits' option of the matrix method
    of the toLatex generic to the more sensible getOption("digits")
  - the matrix method of the toLatex generic gains new optional arguments
    'show.vars', 'show.xvar', and 'show.yvar', which determine whether
    the name of the row and/or the column variable should be shown if
    the matrix is a 2-dimensional table.

2010-03-02:
  - fixed minor bug in 'cases' function

2009-11-11:
  - correction bug in .unLoad function.

2009-10-14:
  - removed 'extended' arguments from calls to 'regexpr' and 'sub' etc. (for compatibility
    with R 2.11)

2009-08-19:
  - corrected documentation for mtable (\usepackage instead of usepackage)
  - completed documentation for contrasts generic
  - fixed bug in the internals for 'spss.portable.file':
    'SPSS Por' to ascii and 'SPSS Por' to integer translation tables
    were one item too short.

2009-06-02:
  - as.factor methods for item vectors adapted to new factor function
    in R 2.10.0
  - Fixed bug in sample.data.frame and sample.data.set methods:
    Samples were drawn only from the first m observations, where m is
    the number of variables in the data frame/data set.
