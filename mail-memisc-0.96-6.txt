Dear CRAN maintainers,

I just uploaded version/patchlevel 0.96-6 of the package 'memisc'.

R CMD check --as-cran shows me a NOTE about the use of attach() in the package.
Attach will only be called by the function include() and it is written in such a way that the search path will not be modified unless the user wants it so.

Best regards,

Martin Elff
