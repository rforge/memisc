\section{Introduction}
This vignette gives an example for the analysis of a typical social science data set.
It is the data file of the \emph{American National Election Study} of
1948\footnote{National Election Studies, 1948:
\emph{Post-Election Study [dataset].} Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan, Center for Political Studies [producer and distributor], 1999.
ANES Dataset ID: 1948.T; ICPSR Study Number: 7218.

available from the American National Election Studies website
(\url{http://www.electionstudies.org}). The data file contains data
from to USA-wide surveys conducted October and November 1948
by the Survey Research Centre, University Michigan
(principal investigators: Angus Campbell and Robert L.\ Kahn). The
total number of cases in the data set is 662 and the number of variables
is 65
(more details about this
data set can be found
at \url{http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/1948prepost/1948prepost.htm}).

With 662 cases and 65 variables, the 1948 ANES data set is relatively
small as compared to current social science data sets. Such larger data
sets can be processed along the same lines as in this vignette.
Unlike the 1948 ANES data,
their size as well as, in some cases, legal restrictions prohibit the
inclusion of such a data set into the package, however.

This vignette starts with a demontration how a data file can be
examined before loading it and how a subset of the data can be loaded
into memory.
After loading this subset into memory, some desciptive analyses are
conducted that showcase the construction of contingency tables and of
general tables of desriptive statistics using the
\code{genTable} function. In addition, a logit analysis
is demonstrated and the collection of several logit coefficients into
a comprehensive table by the \texttt{mtable} function.

It should be noted that the analyses reported in the following are conducted
only for purpose of demonstrating the features of the package and are
not to be considered of conclusive scientific evidence of any kind.

\section{Reading In a ``Portable'' SPSS Data File}
We start with importing the data into R.
The following code extracts the SPSS portable file
``\code{NES1948.POR}'' from
zip file ``\code{NES1948.ZIP}'' delivered with the \code{memisc} package.
<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width=72)
@
<<>>=
library(memisc)
options(digits=3)
nes1948.por <- UnZip("anes/NES1948.ZIP","NES1948.POR",package="memisc")
@
Now the portable file is in a temporary directory and the path
to the file is contained in the string variable \code{nes1948.por}.
In the next step, the file is declared as a SPSS/PSPP ``portable''
file using the function \code{PSPPportable}, which as first argument
takes the path to the file in question. \code{PSPPportable}
reads in the information about the variables contained in the data
set and counts the
number of cases in the file. That is, standard
I/O operations are used on the file, but the data read in are just
thrown away without allocating core memory for the data.
This counting of cases can, of course, be suppressed if it would
take to long.
<<>>=
nes1948 <- spss.portable.file(nes1948.por)
print(nes1948)
@
At this stage, the data are not loaded into the memory yet.
But we can see which variables exist inside
the data set:
<<>>=
names(nes1948)
@
We also can ask for a description (``variable label'') for each variable:
<<>>=
description(nes1948)
@
or even a code book using
<<eval=FALSE>>=
codebook(nes1948)
@
(this is not shown
here because the output would have taken more then thirty pages).

\subsection{Reading In a Subset of the Data}
After we have decided which variables to use we can read in a subset of
the data:
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,numbers=left,numbersep=1pt]
% vote.48 <- subset(nes1948,
%               select=c(
%                   v480018,
%                   v480029,
%                   v480030,
%                   v480045,
%                   v480046,
%                   v480047,
%                   v480048,
%                   v480049,
%                   v480050
%                   ))
% \end{Verbatim}
% 
<<eval=TRUE>>=
vote.48 <- subset(nes1948,
              select=c(
                  v480018,
                  v480029,
                  v480030,
                  v480045,
                  v480046,
                  v480047,
                  v480048,
                  v480049,
                  v480050
                  ))
@
The subset of the ANES 1948 we read in is now contained in the
variable \code{vote.48}, which contains an object of class \code{data.set}.
A \code{data.set} is an ``embellished'' version of a \code{data.frame},
a data structure intended to contained \code{labelled} vectors.
\code{labelled} vectors contain the all the special information
attached to the variables in the original data set, such as
variable labels, value labels, and general missing values.
A short summary of this special information shows up after a
call to \code{str}.
<<>>=
str(vote.48)
@
This output shows, for example, that variable \code{v480018}
has the description (variable label) ``DID R VOTE/FOR WHOM'' is considered as
having nominal level of measurement, has seven value labels
and one defined missing value.

Since the variable names in the ANES data set are not very mnemonic,
we rename the variables:
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,numbers=left,numbersep=1pt]
% vote.48 <- rename(vote.48,
%                   v480018 = "vote",
%                   v480029 = "occupation.hh",
%                   v480030 = "unionized.hh",
%                   v480045 = "gender",
%                   v480046 = "race",
%                   v480047 = "age",
%                   v480048 = "education",
%                   v480049 = "total.income",
%                   v480050 = "religious.pref"
%         )
% \end{Verbatim}
% 
<<>>=
vote.48 <- rename(vote.48,
                  v480018 = "vote",
                  v480029 = "occupation.hh",
                  v480030 = "unionized.hh",
                  v480045 = "gender",
                  v480046 = "race",
                  v480047 = "age",
                  v480048 = "education",
                  v480049 = "total.income",
                  v480050 = "religious.pref"
        )
@
Before we start with analyses, we take a closer look at
the data.
<<>>=
codebook(vote.48)
@
We now have obtained a \emph{codebook}, which contains information
of the class and type of the variables in the data set,
the value labels and defined missing values, and counts of
the distinct values of the variables.

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Some Descriptive Analyses}
We start our analyses with a contingency table, but first
we make some preparations: We recode the variables of
interest into a smaller number of categories in order to
get results that are easier to read and interpret.
% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single,numbers=left,numbersep=1pt]
% vote.48 <- within(vote.48,{
%   vote3 <- recode(vote,
%     1   -> "Truman",
%     2   -> "Dewey",
%     3:4 -> "Other"
%     )
%   occup4 <- recode(occupation.hh,
%     10:20 -> "Upper white collar",
%     30    -> "Other white collar",
%     40:70 -> "Blue collar",
%     80    -> "Farmer"
%     )
%   relig3 <- recode(religious.pref,
%     1   -> "Protestant",
%     2   -> "Catholic",
%     3:5 -> "Other/none"
%     )
%    race2 <- recode(race,
%     1 -> "White",
%     2 -> "Black"
%     )
%   })
% \end{Verbatim}
% 
<<>>=
vote.48 <- within(vote.48,{
  vote3 <- recode(vote,
    1 -> "Truman",
    2 -> "Dewey",
    3:4 -> "Other"
    )
  occup4 <- recode(occupation.hh,
    10:20 -> "Upper white collar",
    30 -> "Other white collar",
    40:70 -> "Blue collar",
    80 -> "Farmer"
    )
  relig3 <- recode(religious.pref,
    1 -> "Protestant",
    2 -> "Catholic",
    3:5 -> "Other,none"
    )
   race2 <- recode(race,
    1 -> "White",
    2 -> "Black"
    )
  })
@

Having constructed the unordered factors
\code{vote3}, \code{occup4}, \code{relig3}, and \code{race2} we can
proceed examining the association the vote, occupational class,
relgious denomination, and race. First, we look upon a simple
contingency table. We use the \code{toLatex} method defined
for tables to get a nicely formatted output. (The generic
function \code{toLatex} is defined in package \code{utils}.)
\begin{center}
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(xtabs(~vote3+occup4,data=vote.48))
@
\end{center}
\vspace{12pt}\par
Tables of percentages may seem more informative about the impact
of various factors on the vote. So we use the function
\code{genTable} to obtain such tables of percentages:
\begin{center}
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(t(genTable(percent(vote3)~occup4,data=vote.48)),
  digits=c(1,1,1,0))
@
\end{center}

Obviously, voters from farmer and blue collar worker households
were especially supportive of President Truman, while voters
of upper white collar background largely supported
the Republican Candidate Dewey.

\begin{center}
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(t(genTable(percent(vote3)~relig3,data=vote.48)),
  digits=c(1,1,1,0))
@
\end{center}

This table shows that Catholics and adherents of other denominations
were more supportive of Truman than of Dewey.

\begin{center}
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(t(genTable(percent(vote3)~race2,data=vote.48)),
  digits=c(1,1,1,0))
@
\end{center}

African Americans apparently supported Truman by a large majority. The
number of members of this group in the sample is very small, however,
so that such an inference would be very shaky.

\begin{center}
<<results=tex>>=
inc.tab <- t(genTable(percent(vote3)~total.income,data=vote.48))
rownames(inc.tab) <- gsub("$","\\$",rownames(inc.tab),fixed=TRUE)
toLatex(inc.tab,digits=c(1,1,1,0))
@
\end{center}

The table of percentage of vote by income suggests that income had
some considerable influence on the choice either of Truman or of Dewey,
but the unequal distribution of income categories warrants a more
refined analysis that takes into account the uncertainty about the
vote percentages. Therefore, the percentages of support for Truman
broken down by income is plotted along with confidence intervals,
showcasing the \code{panel.errbars} function of package \code{memisc}:
<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width=60)
@
<<>>=
agg.inc <- aggregate(percent(vote3,ci=TRUE)~total.income,data=vote.48)
agg.inc.errbars <- xyplot(cbind(Percentage,upper,lower)~total.income,
        data=subset(agg.inc,vote3=="Truman"),
        panel=panel.errbars,
        xlab="Household income",
        ylab="Percentage voting for Truman",
        pch=19,ewidth=0.2,
        scales=list(x=list(
          rot=90
          )),
        )
@
% Automatic inclusion does not work here - why?
<<eval=FALSE>>=
print(agg.inc.errbars)
@
<<results=hide,echo=FALSE>>=
trellis.device(pdf,file="agg-inc-errbars.pdf",width=6,height=6)
print(agg.inc.errbars)
dev.off()
trellis.device(postscript,file="agg-inc-errbars.eps",width=6,height=6)
print(agg.inc.errbars)
dev.off()
@
<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(width=72)
@
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{agg-inc-errbars}
\end{center}

The plot suggests that Truman found support especially among the middle- and lower-income
groups. However, as the counts in the table of percentages already suggested, the
number of members of lower-income groups in the sample is too small to make precise
statements about the level of support for Truman in these groups: For the lowest
income group, the 95\% confidence interval ranges from below 20 percent to above 80 percent.

Occupational class is more evenly distributed in the sample, thus it may be possible
to obtain more precise estimates of the percentages of support for Truman for occupational
classes:
<<>>=
agg.occup <- aggregate(percent(vote3,ci=TRUE)~occup4,data=vote.48)
agg.occup.errbars <- xyplot(cbind(Percentage,upper,lower)~occup4,
        data=subset(agg.occup,vote3=="Truman"),
        panel=panel.errbars,
        xlab="Occupation head of household",
        ylab="Percentage voting for Truman",
        pch=19,ewidth=0.2,
        scales=list(x=list(
          rot=90
          )),
        )
@
% Automatic inclusion does not work here - why?
<<eval=FALSE>>=
print(agg.occup.errbars)
@
<<results=hide,echo=FALSE>>=
trellis.device(pdf,file="agg-occup-errbars.pdf",width=6,height=6)
print(agg.occup.errbars)
dev.off()
trellis.device(postscript,file="agg-occup-errbars.eps",width=6,height=6)
print(agg.occup.errbars)
dev.off()
@
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{agg-occup-errbars}
\end{center}
The upper and lower white-collar and blue-collar classes are quite distinct
with regard to the percentages of support for Truman. The point estimates
of the percentages are outside the confidence intervals of the respective
other occupational classes, the confidence intervals do not even overlap.
However, it is not clear whether farmers are distinct from the blue-collar
and lower white-collar classes.

\subsection{Logit Modelling of Candidate Choice}

In the following we conduct a logit analysis of the vote for Truman.
First, we assign non-standard contrasts the categorical predictors.
Here, the function \code{contr} is used to assign treatment (dummy)
contrasts to \code{occup4} and \code{total.income} with
baseline category 3 and 4, respectively.
<<>>=
vote.48 <- within(vote.48,{
  contrasts(occup4) <- contr("treatment",base = 3)
  contrasts(total.income) <- contr("treatment",base = 4)
  })
@
We now fit some logistic regression models of the
impact occupational class, income, and religious denomination
on the vote choice supporting Truman. The contrasts of
the occupational class and income factors are such that they
compare the choices of the members of the blue-collar class
with all other classes and the middle income group (\$ 2000-2999)
with the other income groups. The religious denomination factor
compares Protestants with Catholics and those with other or
no denominations.
<<>>=
model1 <- glm((vote3=="Truman")~occup4,data=vote.48,
              family="binomial")
model2 <- glm((vote3=="Truman")~total.income,data=vote.48,
              family="binomial")
model3 <- glm((vote3=="Truman")~occup4+total.income,data=vote.48,
              family="binomial")
model4 <- glm((vote3=="Truman")~relig3,data=vote.48,
              family="binomial")
model5 <- glm((vote3=="Truman")~occup4+relig3,data=vote.48,
              family="binomial")
@
First, we use \code{mtable} to construct a comparative table
of the estimates of \code{model1},
\code{model2}, and \code{model3}. We thus can compare
the impact of occupational class and income on the choice of
candidate Truman.
<<>>=
mtable(model1,model2,model3,summary.stats=c("Nagelkerke R-sq.","Deviance","AIC","N"))
@
\code{mtable} returns an object of class \code{"mtable"}. The
\code{print} method for this class produces output as seen above.
This output has a format close to the requirements of social science
publications. With the \code{toLatex} method for objects of this
class one can produce almost publication-ready output:

\begin{center}
\footnotesize
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(relabel(mtable(
            "Model 1"=model1,
            "Model 2"=model2,
            "Model 3"=model3,
            summary.stats=c("Nagelkerke R-sq.","Deviance","AIC","N")),
          "[(]Intercept[)]"="\\\\emph{Intercept}",
          "[$]"="\\\\$",
          UNDER="under",
          "AND OVER"="and over",
          occup4="Occup. class",
          total.income="Income",
          gsub=TRUE
          ),
          ddigits=5
        )
@
\end{center}

The comparison of the pseudo-R-Square values of model 1 and 2 suggests that
occupational class has a stronger influence on a preference for Truman than
household income. Indeed, if occupational class is taken into account, the
effect of income is no longer statistically significant as the column
corresponding to model 3 indicates.

Second, we compare the effect of occupational class and religious denomination
on the preference for Truman along the same lines as above. We use
\code{mtable} to collect the estimates of \code{model1}, \code{model4},
and \code{model5} into a common table.

\begin{center}
\footnotesize
<<results=tex>>=
toLatex(relabel(mtable(
              "Model 1"=model1,
              "Model 4"=model4,
              "Model 5"=model5,
              summary.stats=c("Nagelkerke R-sq.","Deviance","AIC","N")),
          "[(]Intercept[)]"="\\\\emph{Intercept}",
            occup4="Occup. class",
            relig3="Religion",
            gsub=TRUE
            ),
          ddigits=5)
@
\end{center}

A comparison of the pseudo-R-squared values suggests that also the effect of
religious denomination is weaker than that of occupational class. However,
as the third column in the above table indicates the effect of religious
denomination remains statistically significant.
